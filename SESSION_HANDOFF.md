# Session Handoff — SaneHosts

**Last updated:** 2026-02-03

## ACTION REQUIRED: Xcode 26.3 MCP Migration (Feb 3)

Apple released **Xcode 26.3 RC** with `xcrun mcpbridge` — official MCP replacing community XcodeBuildMCP.

**Already done globally:** `~/.claude.json` has `xcode` server, `~/.claude/settings.json` has `mcp__xcode__*` permission. XcodeBuildMCP removed from global config.

**TODO in this project:**
1. **`CLAUDE.md`** — Replace XcodeBuildMCP references (lines ~47, 98, 105, 112-115)
2. **`.mcp.json`** — Remove XcodeBuildMCP entry (Cursor config)
3. **`.saneprocess`** — Check/update if references XcodeBuildMCP

**xcode quick ref:** 20 tools via `xcrun mcpbridge`. Needs Xcode running + project open. All tools need `tabIdentifier` (get from `XcodeListWindows`). Key tools: `BuildProject`, `RunAllTests`, `RunSomeTests`, `RenderPreview`, `DocumentationSearch`, `GetBuildLog`.
